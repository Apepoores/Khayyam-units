# Khayyam Units 0.2 Beta

## What is Khayyam units
It's a program written in python which aims to automate the selecting units of khayyam university. It can be used for all students of all majors.

## How to use it
We tried our best to implement it as user friendly as possible. In fact you have a few steps before your units being selected.
  
### 1. Download the program and run  
There are two ways you can use the program.  
  
**1.1 Download the compiled file (for windows users only)**  
We have compiled the program for windows users. You can simply download the rar file from our official telegram channel (https://t.me/khayyamunits) and run it as soon as you extract the file.  
  
**2.2 Compile the source file (for all platforms)**  
if you are using any platform other than windows or if you are a developer you can download the source code and compile it. Remember to install the requirements which are:
 - Python 3.X.X  
 - BeautifulSoup, requests, tkinter, arabic_reshaper python packages (easily installable check their documentation)  
   
 > Note: to install the arab_reshaper you should run:
 ```
 pip install git+https://github.com/mpcabd/python-arabic-reshaper
 ```
 on your terminal.
### 2. Login with your university information (username and password)
After running the program you need to enter your university account information. Be sure to enter the correct information (the website will block you for a few mintues in case of repeatedly wrong password and our program can't do anything about that).

### 3. Add your lessons ID and group

You need to simply enter your desired lessons ID and group once and our program will remember them for later usages.
### 4. Set the timer and hit the start

You will have to set the timer before you hit the start button. This timer will tell our program how many hours it should wait before trying to select the units. It means if you leave it 0 the program will start the unit selecting process as soon as you touch the start button (in other words, if you fill this field with number x, the unit selecting will start x hours after you click on start).

## Is it safe?
We guarantee our program to be **100%** safe to use, but the source code is available and you can check the program.
